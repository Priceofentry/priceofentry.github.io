Thousands of immigrants come to Canada every year, yet not many programs are in place to help them successfully transition to their new lives. Unfortunately, young immigrants feel the most pressure when they are forced to become the bilingual bridge between their home and the outside world, realizing that safe, may not necessarily mean peaceful. 

Wonderful Wonderful came to Canada with his family when he was 13-years-old. His family was forced to flee his village in Burma, and had to live in a refugee camp for 10 years before they were able to come to Canada. 

Visnja Milidragovic came to Canada with her family in 1994. Her family had to leave their home in former Yugoslavia after the war broke out and decided to come to Canada. 

Visnja was six when they first arrived to Vancouver. Both Visnja and Wonderful wanted to share their stories through this documentary, to help shed light on some of the pressures young immigrants face when they come to Canada. Many end up having to worry about their new lives, as well as their parentsâ€™ needs. 

An average of 250,000 immigrants come to Canada every year. Even though Canada provided a safer living environment, many face incredible difficulties adapting to their new lives. Several of those challenges are a product of poor language proficiency. Such is the case with Visjna, Wonderful, and their families. 

Below is a map that displays the top 10 countries of origin of refugee claimants coming to Canada in 2012. The map showcases the diversity of those who come to Canada.

In order for people to have an easier transition to their new lives, it is vital to pay attention to the programs that are available to them to help them adapt to a foreign county. Even the simplest of tasks can become overwhelming when there is no method to relate or communicate.
