                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>This documentary hopes to shed light on the pressures children of refugee and immigrant families face when they first arrive to Canada. </p>

                <p>Although Canada provides a safer or "better" living environment, these young individuals still face incredible challenges daily. By quickly becoming the bilingual bridge for their family, many end up having to play a more involved role in their family compared to those native to Canada.</p>

                <p>Canada accepts an average of 23,000 refugees each year. The support offered to immigrant families and their children has a strong impact on their experience trying to adapt to their new lives. It could be argued not enough attention is paid to the pressures unintentionally imposed on young immigrants who end up having to deal with adult responsibilities early in life, due to the many barriers their parents encounter.</p>

                            <h1>More to come...</h1>
            <p>The first draft of our documentary has been completed and submitted. Both of us are really pleased with the way the production came together. However, there is still room for improvement! With the extra time we have been allotted, we now have an opportunity to make our project even better. We plan to make some minor changes to the writing, mainly the introduction. We plan to add an extra voice-over at the end and use that to conclude our doc. There is also the possibility of us speaking with one of our characters parents. If that is possible we will most likely be adding an extra voice to our project as well.</p>

            <p>In two weeks our next version of the documentary will be completed, stay tuned for more!</p>
